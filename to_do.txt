To Do:

- Saving/logging stuff; see Bhairav's suggestions

	Scalars:
	Training loss (Actor and Critic)
	Training Reward (Avg)
	Training Action (Norm)

	Same with evaluation

	Images:
	Start Obs
	end Obs

	Histograms
	Histogram of Action
	People also do histograms of gradients / weights but I don't really.


- VAE; 

- smooth action; average over 2-3 timesteps... averaged action

- multiple frames of observation [4 frames stacked]

- Remove the horizon!

- constant forward speed
