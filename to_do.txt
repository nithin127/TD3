To Do:

- Saving/logging stuff;

	Scalars:
	Training Reward (Avg)
	Training Action (Norm)

	Same with evaluation
	Test loss (Actor and Critic)
	Test Action (Norm)

	Images:
	Start Obs
	end Obs

	Histograms
	Histogram of Action; (at every x timesteps)
	People also do histograms of gradients / weights but I don't really.


- VAE; 

- multiple frames of observation [4 frames stacked]

- Remove the horizon!

- constant forward speed; check the actions it is taking
