To Do:

- check if GPU is being used properly
	So after line 121 add a new line that says
	`print ("critic side is on cuda: ", critic_loss.is_cuda)`
	and after what's currently line 130 you add a new line `print ("actor side is on cuda: ", actor_loss.is_cuda)`

- PPO!

- sbatch run/ cluster operations
	Try to run the same in a random cluster: NGC
	Setup ssh; send/receive files in random cluster

- multiple frames of observation [4 frames stacked]

- resume training; args

- logging stuff;

	Same with evaluation
	Test loss (Actor and Critic)
	Test Action (Norm)

	Images:
	Start Obs
	end Obs

- VAE; 

- Remove the horizon!

- constant forward speed; check the actions it is taking
